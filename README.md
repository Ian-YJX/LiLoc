In this work, we propose a versatile graph-based lifelong localization framework, <strong>LiLoc</strong> , which enhances its timeliness by maintaining a single central session while improves the accuracy through multi-modal factors between the central and subsidiary sessions. The main contributions are as follows:

- A graph-based framework for long-term localization featuring a flexible mode-switching mechanism, to achieve accurate multi-session localization.
- An adaptive submap joining strategy to dynamically manage (i.e., generate, select and update) prior submaps, reducing system memory consumption while ensuring the timeliness of prior knowledge.
- An egocentric factor graph (EFG) module to tightly couple multi-modal constrains, along with a novel propagation model to enhance  prior constrains by distributing weighted scan matching factors in joint factor-graph optimization (JFGO). 
- We achieve the competitive performance on public and custom datasets and the proposed system will be released for community use.

## Installation
### 1. Prerequisites
#### 1.1 System and third-party packages
- Ubuntu $\geq$ 18.04 (tested on Ubuntu 20.04)

- PCL $\geq$ 1.8 (tested on PCL 1.10)

- OpenCV $\geq$ 4.0 (tested on OpenCV 4.2)

- GTSAM $\geq$ 4.0.0 (tested on GTSAM 4.0.2)

#### 1.2 Other Packages
- [ndt_omp](https://github.com/koide3/ndt_omp)
- [better_fastlio2](https://github.com/Yixin-F/better_fastlio2) (Refer to the module of "pose initialization" in this open-source repositories, the new reconstructed code is comming soon.)

### 2. Build
```bash
cd <your workspace>/src
git clone https://github.com/koide3/ndt_omp
git clone https://github.com/YixFeng/Block-Map-Based-Localization

cd ..
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
```

## Run
We provide some [Block Maps](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Z2K56jTkMOouZhM4c9JhPvqyDxGFiXSY/view?usp=drive_link) (Google Drive) to make your tests easy.

### 1. NCLT
Download NCLT from [https://robots.engin.umich.edu/nclt/](https://robots.engin.umich.edu/nclt/)
```bash
roslaunch block_localization run_nclt.launch
```

### 2. M2DGR
Download M2DGR from [https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/M2DGR](https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS/M2DGR)
```bash
roslaunch block_localization run_m2dgr.launch
```
*Remarks:*
Since BM-Loc is a map-based localization method, you need to provide the directory where maps are stored. Edit the parameter `globalmap_dir` in `config/*.yaml` files.
